#Conclusion

If you’ve gotten this far without giving up, you should be ready to solve anything that can be solved with binary search. Try to keep a few things in mind:

Design a predicate which can be efficiently evaluated and so that binary search can be applied

Decide on what you’re looking for and code so that the search space always contains that (if it exists)

If the search space consists only of integers, test your algorithm on a two-element set to be sure it doesn’t lock up

Verify that the lower and upper bounds are not overly constrained: it’s usually better to relax them as long as it doesn’t break the predicate
